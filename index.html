    <!-- <p> Long-text generation is seemingly ubiquitous in real world applications of large language models and yet personalization of long-text generation has not been explored. Though there has been a lot of interest in personalization of large language models, recent works have only focussed on short text generation. This work aims to fill this gap by providing LongLaMP a comprehensive evaluation framework for long-text generation focussing on different variations of long-text. LongLaMP is a benchmark that provides a comprehensive and diverse evaluation framework for personalized long-text generation. </p>   -->
    <!-- <p> LongLaMP is a collection of datasets focused exclusively on the challenging task of long text generation, where each dataset is focused on a distinctive domain.

    <p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text generation tasks, but their performance in personalized long-text generation remains largely unexplored. While recent works have focused on personalization for short-text generation, there is a need for a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to long-text generation, considering its widespread real-world applications.</p>
    <p>LongLaMP aims to fill this gap by providing a benchmark specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of LLMs in generating personalized, long-text outputs. It is a collection of datasets spanning diverse domains, each focused on the challenging task of long-text generation.
